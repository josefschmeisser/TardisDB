Configuration:
The following Preprocessor Options can be used to control the build:
USE_INTERNAL_NULL_INDICATOR
USE_LLVM_SELECT
USE_NEW_EXTRACT
LOAD_NULLABLE

Build:
Create a build directory and invoke cmake inside that directory:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <source path>
make

Run:
Remember to put a directory named "tables" with the database data inside the build directory.
Invoke the llvm-prototype executable without any additional arguments.

Using Schemas:
The default SQL Schema, namely 'schema.sql', resides inside the 'schemas' directory.
This file will be treated like any other source file,
therefore a simple rebuild is enough to reflect any change to this file.
